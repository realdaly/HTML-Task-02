        <h3>Benefits:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Self-analysis: Just like in any other game, you are given a second chance to make things right after losing through the first attempt. We all treasure second chances, and therefore you can take the time to seriously analyze where you went wrong to turn your loss into a future win</li>
            <li>Decision making: Real time strategy games are very hard. Thereâ€™s no room for careless mistakes. Making a quick purchase, a merger or joining a pact could save your empire.</li>
            <li>Learning new tricks: In RTS games, a rookie or an average player will not make reasonable progress unless he/she uses Metagaming. This is a trick used to outwit other players by mastering their gaming moves and then using them as a weapon against them.</li>
        </ul>
